= Current Project Progress:
1) Working on image upload + slicing, will come back to this after writing logic for actual slide puzzle. 
 ... An image would be cooler than numbered tiles, but if the only thing I have to show is an image slicer, that is not much of a game.

Note: Not a great week, academically. Unfortunate to see, I will catch up.
